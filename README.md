INTRODUCTION:<br>
In this notebook, we will build Machine learning models using which we can accurately detect the presence of Parkinson’s disease in one’s body. Here, we are using SVM(Support Vector Machines),  KNN(K- Nearest Neighbors), Random Forest, XGB(Extreme Gradient Boosting) for comparing their performances on Parkinson’s Disease dataset. 
DATA:<br>
Parkinson’s Disease dataset is used for detecting the disease in an individual. This data contains 195 rows and 24 columns with each column is a voice measure of 195 individuals.
